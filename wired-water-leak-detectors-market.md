<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wired Water Leak Detectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Leak Detector</li><li>Active Leak Detector</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wired water leak detectors market encompasses two primary types: passive and active leak detectors. Passive leak detectors are designed to alert users when water is detected through sensors that remain stationary. They require manual inspection for maintenance and are often used in residential applications. Conversely, active leak detectors not only sense water but can also trigger automatic responses, such as shutting off water supply, thus minimizing damage. These are commonly employed in commercial settings where rapid response is critical.</p></p>

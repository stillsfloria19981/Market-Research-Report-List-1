<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Infrastructure Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquefaction Terminal</li><li>Regasification Terminal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) infrastructure market consists primarily of two key segments: liquefaction terminals and regasification terminals. Liquefaction terminals convert natural gas into LNG by cooling it to very low temperatures, enabling easier transportation and storage. In contrast, regasification terminals are facilities where LNG is converted back into gaseous form for distribution and use in power generation, heating, and industrial applications. Both types are crucial for facilitating the global trade and supply of natural gas.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Braking System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Disc</li><li>Drum</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive braking system market includes two primary types: disc and drum brakes. Disc brakes use a rotor and caliper to create friction, offering superior stopping power, heat dissipation, and performance, making them ideal for modern vehicles. Drum brakes, on the other hand, use brake shoes inside a drum, providing cost-effectiveness and durability, often used in rear wheels of budget or older vehicles. Both systems are essential, with disc brakes dominating high-performance and safety-focused markets, while drum brakes remain relevant for economical and lightweight applications.</p></p>

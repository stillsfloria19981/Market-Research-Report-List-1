<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The N95 Protective Masks Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mask with Exhalation Valve</li><li>Mask without Exhalation Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The N95 mask market includes two main types: masks with and without exhalation valves. Masks with exhalation valves feature a one-way valve that reduces breathing resistance, making them more comfortable for prolonged use, especially in hot or physically demanding environments. However, they offer less protection to others as exhaled air is not filtered. Masks without exhalation valves filter both inhaled and exhaled air, providing better protection for both the wearer and those around them, making them ideal for healthcare and high-risk settings.</p></p>
